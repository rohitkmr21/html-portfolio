<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Rohit Kumar, an Electronics and Computer Engineering student at SRM Institute of Science & Technology, Chennai,
   with a strong passion for IoT, embedded systems, and circuit design. Alongside my academic journey, I have built 
   hands-on experience through internships at NSIC and TVS Training & Services, where I worked on IoT applications, 
   Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and smart device integrations.</p>

<p>I enjoy combining hardware and software to create innovative solutions. Some of my notable projects include 
  a Retail Theft Detection System using YOLOv3 and OpenCV, and a Smart Parking System using Arduino, both of which 
  highlight my skills in machine learning, sensors, embedded systems, and real-time data communication. These projects 
  also earned me recognition such as the Meritorious Award at Project Expo.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working as a Sales and Service Engineer at Scientific Research and Instruments Company Pvt. Ltd., 
  where I contribute to research and development in the core electrical engineering and manufacturing domain.</p>

  <p>I constantly strive to learn and explore new technologies. My certifications and workshops in Java, PSPICE, 
    AI tools, data visualization, and drone technology reflect my enthusiasm for continuous learning and upskilling.</p>

  <p>Beyond academics, I am an electronics enthusiast, love photo and video editing, and enjoy exploring AI tools. 
    I am fluent in Hindi and English, with beginner-level knowledge of Japanese.</p>

  <p>With a blend of technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and hands-on project experience, I aim to contribute 
    meaningfully to innovative engineering solutions while continuing to grow professionally.</p>
